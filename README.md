## 💡 What is Doohickey?

**Doohickey** is a peer-to-peer platform that helps people rent out and borrow unused items, services, and spaces. It addresses the everyday problem of owning things you only need temporarily — by turning underutilized assets into income opportunities while reducing waste and clutter.

The platform enables users to:
- Post and track their unused items
- Rent from others affordably
- Use AI to auto-fill listings
- Split rental costs with friends
- Create group rentals and item subscriptions
- Track inventory and manage personal belongings
