# Doohickey-Showcase

This is a public showcase of **Doohickey.ai**, the flagship marketplace platform I co-founded. While the original repository is now publicly available [here](https://github.com/aj7774/Doohickey), this version highlights **my individual work and contributions** for portfolio and professional reference purposes.

> 📱 Doohickey.ai was built as a **cross-platform marketplace** available on web, iOS, and Android.  
> 🌐 It was part of the broader **Doohickey company**, which also worked on other software initiatives.

## 💡 What is Doohickey.ai?

**Doohickey.ai** is a peer-to-peer rental marketplace that enables people to lend or borrow unused items, services, and spaces. It addresses a growing need: accessing things affordably without owning them long-term.

This platform lets users:
- Post and manage their inventory of personal items  
- Rent items from others for short or long periods  
- Split rental costs with friends  
- Use AI to auto-fill item listings from photos  
- Pass rented items directly from borrower to borrower  
- Track transfers safely with confirmations and deposits

> While **Doohickey.ai** was the company’s core product, the **Doohickey team** also explored other software projects outside this specific marketplace.
