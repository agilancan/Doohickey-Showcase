# Doohickey-Showcase

This is a public showcase of **Doohickey**, a startup project I co-founded. The original repository is private, and this version is intended to highlight my work and contributions for portfolio and professional reference purposes.

## 💡 What is Doohickey?

Doohickey is a peer-to-peer platform that enables people to rent out their unused items, services, and spaces. It was built to solve a common problem: people often buy things they only need temporarily, which ends up costing money, taking up space, and going unused. Doohickey allows users to generate income and save space by renting out these underutilized assets — and rent what they need from others, affordably and flexibly.

## 🧠 My Role

I was the **CEO and co-founder** of Doohickey. While I contributed to the frontend development in React, my primary responsibilities included:

- Defining the **product vision**, feature set, and overall functionality
- Leading the **UX and UI design**, including user flows and visual design
- Creating all **branding and product visuals**
- Writing the full **business plan** and **go-to-market strategy**
- Managing **marketing**, **user testing**, and **customer engagement**
- Pitching to investors, including applying to programs like **MaRS Venture Services**

## 🌟 Key Features of the Platform

- AI-powered item listings (auto-generates name, description, pricing from a photo)
- Group rentals and cost splitting via digital wallet
- Inventory management for personal or commercial use
- Borrower-to-borrower item transfers
- Safety measures: delivery tracking, deposit protections, confirmation photos

## 🚀 Our Journey

- Co-founded the company in **July 2017**
- Alpha launched in **October 2017** (12 users onboarded for testing)
- Final release launched in **September 2019**, growing to **45 users** and over **100 items posted**
